## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Verify System Status**
   - Check current Java Lavalink health
   - Verify client connections
   - Confirm audio functionality

2. **Final Preparations**
   - Create pre-migration backup
   - Verify Rust binary integrity
   - Confirm rollback readiness

### Phase 2: Service Migration (10-15 minutes)
1. **Stop Java Lavalink Service** (2 minutes)
   - Graceful shutdown of Java service
   - Verify all connections closed
   - Confirm service stopped

2. **Deploy Rust Lavalink** (5-8 minutes)
   - Install Rust binary
   - Configure systemd service
   - Start Rust Lavalink service

3. **Initial Validation** (3-5 minutes)
   - Verify service startup
   - Check API responsiveness
   - Confirm basic functionality

### Phase 3: Validation and Monitoring (10-15 minutes)
1. **Connection Validation** (5 minutes)
   - Test client reconnections
   - Verify WebSocket connectivity
   - Validate session management

2. **Audio Functionality Testing** (5-10 minutes)
   - Test YouTube audio playback
   - Test SoundCloud audio playback
   - Test HTTP audio streaming
   - Verify player controls (play, pause, stop, seek)

3. **Performance Monitoring** (Ongoing)
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Monitor CPU utilization
   - Monitor response times
   - Monitor error rates

## Migration Commands

### Stop Java Lavalink
```bash
sudo systemctl stop lavalink-java
sudo systemctl disable lavalink-java
```

### Deploy Rust Lavalink
```bash
cd /path/to/lavalink-rust
sudo ./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Verify Deployment
```bash
sudo systemctl status lavalink-rust
curl -f http://localhost:2333/v4/info
```

## Validation Checklist

### ✅ Service Health
- [ ] Rust Lavalink service running
- [ ] API endpoints responding
- [ ] WebSocket connections accepting
- [ ] No error logs in systemd journal

### ✅ Client Connectivity
- [ ] Discord bots can connect
- [ ] WebSocket handshake successful
- [ ] Session management working
- [ ] Player creation successful

### ✅ Audio Functionality
- [ ] YouTube tracks loading and playing
- [ ] SoundCloud tracks loading and playing
- [ ] HTTP audio streams working
- [ ] Player controls responsive (play/pause/stop/seek)
- [ ] Volume control working
- [ ] Track seeking functional

### ✅ Performance Metrics
- [ ] Memory usage < 1GB (vs ~2GB Java)
- [ ] CPU usage stable and efficient
- [ ] Response times < 100ms
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

## Rollback Procedure

If any critical issues are detected:

1. **Immediate Rollback** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   sudo ./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Java Service**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status lavalink-java
   curl -f http://localhost:2333/version
   ```

3. **Validate Rollback**
   - Test client connections
   - Verify audio functionality
   - Confirm system stability

## Success Criteria

Migration is considered successful when:
- ✅ Rust Lavalink service running stably
- ✅ All client connections restored
- ✅ Audio playback functioning correctly
- ✅ Performance metrics within expected ranges
- ✅ No critical errors in logs
- ✅ System monitoring shows healthy status

## Post-Migration Tasks

1. **Monitor for 24 hours**
   - Watch system metrics
   - Monitor error logs
   - Track performance trends

2. **Update documentation**
   - Mark migration as complete
   - Update operational procedures
   - Archive Java-specific documentation

3. **Team notification**
   - Announce successful migration
   - Share new operational procedures
   - Provide Rust-specific troubleshooting guide

## Emergency Contacts

- **Primary Engineer:** Available during migration window
- **Backup Engineer:** On standby for rollback assistance
- **Operations Team:** Monitoring system health

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:** Comprehensive testing completed, rollback procedures ready
**Mitigation:** Immediate rollback capability, 24/7 monitoring
**Impact:** Minimal - improved performance and stability expected
