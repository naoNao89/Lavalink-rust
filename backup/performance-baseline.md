# Java Lavalink Performance Baseline

## System Information
- **Date**: 2025-01-18
- **Rust Version**: 1.86.0 (05f9846f8 2025-03-31)
- **System**: macOS (Darwin)
- **Working Directory**: Documents/augment-projects/Lavalink-rust

## Java Lavalink Configuration Backup
- **Configuration File**: `backup/java-config-backup.yml`
- **Key Settings**:
  - Port: 2333
  - Password: youshallnotpass
  - YouTube: false (deprecated, requires plugin)
  - Bandcamp: true
  - SoundCloud: true
  - Twitch: true
  - Vimeo: true
  - Niconico: true
  - HTTP: true
  - Local: false

## Expected Performance Improvements (Rust vs Java)
Based on research and benchmarks:
- **Memory Usage**: ~50% reduction expected
- **Startup Time**: Significantly faster (native binary vs JVM)
- **CPU Usage**: More consistent (no GC pauses)
- **Latency**: Lower and more predictable
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better concurrent connection handling

## Baseline Metrics to Measure
### Memory Usage
- [ ] Idle memory consumption
- [ ] Memory usage under load (multiple concurrent streams)
- [ ] Memory growth patterns over time
- [ ] Peak memory usage during high activity

### CPU Usage
- [ ] Idle CPU consumption
- [ ] CPU usage during audio processing
- [ ] CPU spikes during connection establishment
- [ ] CPU efficiency under concurrent load

### Response Times
- [ ] REST API endpoint response times (/v4/info, /v4/stats, /v4/loadtracks)
- [ ] WebSocket connection establishment time
- [ ] Track loading times for different sources
- [ ] Audio playback latency

### Startup Performance
- [ ] Cold start time (first launch)
- [ ] Warm start time (subsequent launches)
- [ ] Configuration loading time
- [ ] Service readiness time

### Concurrent Performance
- [ ] Maximum concurrent connections supported
- [ ] Performance degradation under load
- [ ] Connection handling efficiency
- [ ] Multi-session support performance

## Current Status
- **Java Implementation**: Available in `lavalink-java/` directory
- **Rust Implementation**: In development, compiles successfully
- **Dependencies**: yt-dlp not yet installed (required for YouTube support)
- **Configuration**: Compatible application.yml ready for testing

## Next Steps
1. Install yt-dlp dependency
2. Test Rust implementation startup
3. Measure baseline performance metrics
4. Compare against Java implementation
5. Document performance improvements
