- ‚úÖ Integration with player system is properly implemented
- ‚ùå No actual Discord voice connection implementation found
- ‚ùå VoiceState fields are initialized with empty/default values
- ‚ùå No voice connection establishment or management logic

### Task 1.2 Results: Songbird Integration Analysis ‚úÖ

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies Configured**: Songbird 0.5 with "builtin-queue" feature in Cargo.toml
- ‚úÖ **Serenity Integration**: Serenity 0.12 with "voice", "gateway", "rustls_backend" features
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: README acknowledges Songbird for Discord voice support
- ‚ùå **No Implementation**: No actual Songbird imports or usage found in codebase
- ‚ùå **No Voice Client**: No voice client initialization or management code

**Available Capabilities (Not Yet Used):**
- Songbird provides Discord voice connection management
- Built-in audio queue system available
- Voice gateway integration through Serenity
- Audio streaming and encoding capabilities
- Voice event handling and connection recovery

**Implementation Gap:**
- Dependencies are ready but no integration code exists

### Task 1.4 Results: Connection Implementation Requirements ‚úÖ

**Core Implementation Requirements:**

1. **Songbird Integration Setup:**
   - Initialize Songbird manager with proper configuration
   - Create voice client instances per Discord guild
   - Integrate with existing player management system
   - Handle voice client lifecycle (create, connect, disconnect, cleanup)

2. **Discord Voice Connection Flow:**
   - Receive voice state updates from Discord (token, endpoint, session_id)
   - Establish voice gateway connection using Songbird APIs
   - Handle voice connection state changes and events
   - Implement connection recovery and error handling

3. **Audio Pipeline Integration:**
   - Connect existing AudioPlayerEngine output to Songbird voice client
   - Implement audio streaming from Symphonia decoder to Discord voice
   - Handle audio format conversion (PCM to Opus if needed)
   - Manage audio queue and playback control

4. **Required Songbird APIs:**
   - `Songbird::new()` - Initialize voice manager
   - `Call::join()` - Join voice channels
   - `Call::play()` - Stream audio to Discord
   - `Call::leave()` - Leave voice channels
   - Event handling for connection state changes

5. **Integration Points:**
   - Update `LavalinkPlayer` to include Songbird `Call` handle
   - Modify `PlayerManager` to manage voice connections
   - Connect REST API endpoints to voice operations
   - Integrate voice events with WebSocket message system

### Task 1.5 Results: Discord Voice Protocol Requirements ‚úÖ

**Discord Voice Connection Protocol:**

1. **Voice State Updates (from Discord Gateway):**
   - `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE` event provides `session_id`
   - `VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE` event provides `token` and `endpoint`
   - Both events required to establish voice connection

2. **Voice Gateway Connection Flow:**
   - Connect to voice WebSocket endpoint using provided token
   - Send `IDENTIFY` payload with server_id, user_id, session_id, token
   - Receive `READY` event with connection info (SSRC, IP, port, modes)
   - Establish UDP connection for audio data transmission
   - Send `SELECT_PROTOCOL` to choose encryption mode

3. **Audio Transmission Requirements:**
   - Use UDP for audio data (not WebSocket)
   - Audio must be Opus-encoded at 48kHz, 2 channels
   - RTP packet format with Discord-specific headers
   - Heartbeat mechanism to maintain connection

4. **Connection Management:**
   - Handle reconnection on network issues
   - Implement proper cleanup on disconnect
   - Support for speaking state management
   - Handle voice region changes

**Implementation Notes:**
- Songbird handles all low-level protocol details
- Focus on integration with existing Lavalink player system
- Voice state from Discord must be passed to Songbird for connection
- Audio pipeline needs Opus encoding (Songbird provides this)
