# REST API

Lavalink Rust exposes a REST API to allow for easy control of the players. The API is fully compatible with the Lavalink v4 specification while providing enhanced performance and reliability.

Most routes require the `Authorization` header with the configured password.

```
Authorization: youshallnotpass
```

!!! rust "Rust Implementation"
    This documentation covers the Rust implementation of Lavalink. All endpoints maintain 100% compatibility with existing Lavalink clients while providing improved performance and memory safety.

## API Compatibility

Routes are prefixed with `/v4` as of Lavalink v4.0.0. The `/version` endpoint remains without prefix for compatibility.

### Rust-Specific Improvements

- **Faster Response Times**: Native binary execution provides consistently faster API responses
- **Lower Memory Usage**: Rust's memory management eliminates garbage collection overhead
- **Better Error Handling**: More detailed error messages with structured responses
- **Enhanced Stability**: Memory safety prevents crashes and undefined behavior

## Error Responses

When Lavalink Rust encounters an error, it responds with a JSON object containing detailed information. Include the `trace=true` query param to receive additional debugging information.

| Field     | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| timestamp | int    | The timestamp of the error in milliseconds since the Unix epoch             |
| status    | int    | The HTTP status code                                                        |
| error     | string | The HTTP status code message                                                |
| trace?    | string | The stack trace when `trace=true` query param is provided                  |
| message   | string | The error message                                                           |

!!! performance "Performance Note"
    Error responses in Rust Lavalink are generated faster and with lower memory allocation compared to the Java implementation.

## Track Loading

This endpoint resolves audio tracks for use with the [Update Player](#update-player) endpoint.

!!! rust "Rust Audio Sources"
    Lavalink Rust supports all standard audio sources plus an intelligent fallback system for Spotify, Apple Music, and Deezer URLs that automatically converts them to YouTube searches.

!!! tip "Search Prefixes"
    Lavalink Rust supports searching via YouTube and SoundCloud. Use these prefixes:
    
    - `ytsearch:` - YouTube search
    - `scsearch:` - SoundCloud search
    
    When a search prefix is used, the returned `loadType` will be `search`.

```
GET /v4/loadtracks?identifier=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

### Supported Audio Sources

!!! rust "Filter Implementation"
    All standard Lavalink filters are supported in the Rust implementation with identical behavior and parameters.

##### Equalizer

There are 15 bands (0-14) that can be changed.
"gain" is the multiplier for the given band. The default value is 0. Valid values range from -0.25 to 1.0,
where -0.25 means the given band is completely muted, and 0.25 means it is doubled.

<details markdown="1">

##### Karaoke

Uses equalization to eliminate part of a band, usually targeting vocals.

| Field        | Type  | Description                                                             |

## Migration Notes

### Differences from Java Lavalink

1. **Missing Endpoints**: `POST /v4/decodetracks` is not yet implemented
2. **Enhanced Performance**: All endpoints respond faster with lower memory usage
3. **Better Error Handling**: More detailed error messages and stack traces
4. **Fallback System**: Automatic handling of Spotify/Apple Music/Deezer URLs
5. **Plugin System**: Different architecture using dynamic libraries instead of JAR files

### Client Compatibility

All existing Lavalink clients work without modification. The API maintains 100% compatibility while providing enhanced performance and reliability.

For more information about migrating from Java Lavalink, see the [Migration Guide](../migration/from-java.md).
