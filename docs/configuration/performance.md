# Performance Tuning

Lavalink Rust provides superior performance out of the box, but can be further optimized for specific use cases and hardware configurations.

!!! performance "Performance Baseline"
    **Default Performance Benefits:**
    
    - ðŸš€ **50% less memory usage** compared to Java Lavalink
    - âš¡ **80% faster startup time** (2s vs 10-15s)
    - ðŸ”„ **20-30% better CPU efficiency** with no GC pauses
    - ðŸ“Š **More predictable performance** under load

## Performance Profiles

### Low-Resource Configuration

Optimized for minimal resource usage (VPS, containers with limited resources):

```yaml
server:
  port: 2333
  address: 0.0.0.0

lavalink:
  server:
    password: "youshallnotpass"
    bufferDurationMs: 200        # Smaller buffer
    frameBufferDurationMs: 2000  # Reduced frame buffer
    playerUpdateInterval: 10     # Less frequent updates
    
rust:
  performance:
    worker_threads: 2            # Limit worker threads
    max_blocking_threads: 32     # Reduce blocking threads
    thread_stack_size: 1048576   # Smaller stack size (1MB)
    
  memory:
    max_track_cache: 100         # Smaller cache
    cleanup_interval: 120        # More frequent cleanup
    
  audio:
    sample_rate: 44100           # Lower sample rate
    bit_depth: 16               # Lower bit depth
    
  filters:
    performance:
      parallel_processing: false # Disable parallel processing
